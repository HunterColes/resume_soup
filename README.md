# Resume Soup
## Chi CV template, but Typst

Forked from [chi-cv-template](https://github.com/matchy233/typst-chi-cv-template), which is a rip-off of [skyzh's CV](https://github.com/matchy233/chi-cv-template), using [Typst](https://github.com/typst/typst).

Personal resume repository for Hunter Coles.

## Getting Started

### Locally

Assume that you have installed `typst` cli already and it's in your `$PATH`.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/HunterColes/resume_soup.git
cd resume_soup
typst compile --font-path ./fonts ./src/hunter_mk2.typ ./out/resume.pdf
```
